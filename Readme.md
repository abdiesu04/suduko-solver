## Algorithm

The Sudoku Solver uses the backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles. This algorithm systematically explores all possible solutions by trying different numbers in each cell until a valid solution is found. It utilizes recursive backtracking, which means that if a conflict is encountered, it backtracks to the previous cell and tries a different number. This process continues until a valid solution for the entire puzzle is obtained.
